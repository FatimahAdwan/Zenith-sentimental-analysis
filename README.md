Sentiment analysis is one of the ways to tell peoples emotions in a text format. 
this project is perfomed by obtaining tweet from twitter on the zenith bank users, the analysis were done and using python librabries and 
Dashboards were built using PowerBI
I hope this project helps the zenith bank staff and management to do better as their customers really seems to be upset.
