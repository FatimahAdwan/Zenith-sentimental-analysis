Sentiment analysis is one of the ways to tell people's emotions in a text format. 
this project is perfomed by obtaining tweet from twitter on the zenith bank users, the data scrapping and the data Wrangling/Data exporation/Exploratory analysis is done using the twitter APIs with python librabries and the Explanatory analysis is done using PowerBI, Dashboards were built
I hope this project helps the zenith bank staff and management to do better as their customers really seems to be upset.
